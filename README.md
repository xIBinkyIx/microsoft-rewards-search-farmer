I used charlesbel's before my machine died, then i forgot which i used so i jsut decided to make my own.

you will need to download selenium which you can do typing:
```
pip install selenium
```

and you will need to download the latest webdriver for bing which can be found here:
```
https://msedgedriver.azureedge.net/114.0.1791.0/edgedriver_win64.zip
```

if you would like this script to run each time you turn on your machine just follow the steps below:
```
1. Open the 'microsoft.py' file in notepad.
2. Go to 'File' top left then click 'Save As'.
3. Where you change the file name paste '%appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\microsoft.py'.
4. Take out the ' at the begining and at the end.
```

thats all there is to it really, you don't need to put in any email or password like any other ones will ask, assuming you use bing you'd already be logged in.
