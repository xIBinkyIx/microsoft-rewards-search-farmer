i used someone's on my laptop before i got a pc and the only reason i got a pc was because my laptop died, so I decided to make my own 

you will need to download selenium which you can do typing:
```
pip install selenium
```

and you will need to download the latest webdriver for bing which can be found here:
```

```

thats all there is to it really, you odnt need to put in any email or password like any other ones will ask, assuming you use bing you'd already be logged in
